Case Study for a Successful Brand: Simply Co.

1\. Platform: Founder Lauren Singer wants to reduce environmental waste.

2\. Timeliness: EPA Stats on more waste, giant plastic blob floating in the Pacific. Waste is a hot topic. 

3\. Twist: Not just recycling waste but "precycling," or not using any waste at all.

4\. Testimony: Educational Component/Blog. Started as a simple blog and gained followers. No agenda. Decided to go Zero Waste by using her own containers, no trash in her life. Authenticity.

5\. Twitter: Joined an existing community on social media: European grocery stores, Whole Foods. Bea Johnson, Zero Waste Homes Blog. Reached out and asked her community to help her find more ways to reduce waste. 

6\. Tagline: All of her trash since 2012 she can fit into one Mason jar. Very visual, catchy, authentic.

7\. Tender: She couldn't go all the way without cleaning products. A gap in the market. She can make them herself!
